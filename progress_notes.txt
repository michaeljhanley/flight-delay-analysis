Dataset description (data itself, source)

Business Questions

* Are flights scheduled during peak hours (defined as early morning, evening) more likely to experience departure delays than those scheduled during off-peak (defined as mid-morning, early afternoon) hours?
    * Hypothesis: yes

* Does the proportion of delays caused by late aircraft arrivals vary significantly between early morning and late evening flights?
    * Hypothesis: yes

* What times of day consistently have the longest delays, and how can Alaska Airlines adjust staffing or flight schedules to mitigate this?
    * Conduct a descriptive statistical analysis, then recommend shifting staffing levels or adjusting flight schedules to avoid peak delay times.

* Are departure delays higher for flights scheduled with minimal taxi-out times, and should these estimates be adjusted?
    * Hypothesis: yes
    * If so: Reassess taxi-out time estimates to reduce misalignment with actual conditions.

* Can adjustments to departure times or increased scheduling buffers reduce cascading delays caused by late aircraft arrivals?
    * If so: Review departure schedules for better alignment with arrival timings.
    * Limitation: since the dataset doesn't include arrival data, cascading delays will rely on assumptions/incomplete context [name them here]

Features to be selected: all
Features to be engineered:
	*trip_id (int64): A unique integer identifier for each trip, beginning at 1
	*time_of_day (category): Early Morning, Mid-Morning, Early Afternoon, Evening scheduled departure time
	*delay_flag (int64): 1 if departure_delay > 15, else 0
	*delay_proportion_carrier (float64): Proportion of delay caused by carrier compared to length of all delays
	*delay_proportion_late_aircraft (float64): Proportion of delay caused by late aircraft arrivals compared to length of all delays
	*hour_of_day (int64): Hour from scheduled_departure_time
	*taxi_out_category (category): Categories based on percentiles of taxi_out_time
		*Low Taxi-Out: bottom 25th percentile
		*Medium Taxi-Out: 25th-75th percentile
		*High Taxi-Out: top 25th percentile
	*previous_actual_departure_time (datetime65[ns]): actual departure time of the previous flight for the same tail number
		*Might return NaN, especially if aircraft is first of the day
	*buffer_time (float64): time difference (in minutes) between scheduled_departure_time and previous_actual_departure_time for the same tail number
		*Check if the dates are the same. Calculate if they are - NaN if they're different.
	*mean_departure_delay_by_hour (float64): Aggregates delays by hour_of_day w/ mean function
	*peak_hour_flag (int64): Derived from time_of_day. 1 if time of day is Early Morning or Evening, else 0
	*total_delay (float64): total delay caused by all factors
	

Cross-validation opportunities

	*Check that actual departure time - scheduled departure time = departure delay so that the actual departure time is never earlier than the scheduled departure time
	*Add delay categories to ensure they equal departure delay column
	*Check that wheels off time is always equal to or later than actual departure time, because the flight can't take off before it starts rolling on the runway
	*Taxi_out time always needs to be non-negative, and cannot be greater than the difference between wheels-off time and actual departure time, because taxi time is just a small portion of the time from departure to takeoff (calculated by the aforementioned difference
	*The same tail number should not appear with a conflicting departure datetime
	*Ensure all date and timestamps are formatted consistently
