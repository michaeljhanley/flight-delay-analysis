# Statistical Analysis of Flight Delays at SeaTac Airport [WIP]

## Research Objective
Statistical investigation of operational and temporal factors affecting Alaska Airlines flight delays at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) during 2023. This analysis employs both descriptive and inferential statistics to identify patterns in departure delays and evaluate specific operational hypotheses.

## Research Questions & Statistical Hypotheses
1. **Peak Hour Impact Analysis**
  - H₀: No significant difference in delay probability between peak and non-peak hours
  - H₁: Flights during peak hours (volume > μ + σ) show higher delay probability

2. **Delay Propagation Study**
  - H₀: Equal proportions of late-aircraft delays across time periods
  - H₁: Significant variation in delay propagation between morning/evening flights

3. **Schedule Optimization Analysis**
  - Primary focus: Temporal patterns in delay duration

4. **Taxi-Out Time Impact**
  - H₀: No correlation between taxi-out duration and departure delays
  - H₁: Shorter scheduled taxi times correlate with increased delays

## Status
✅ **Data Preprocessing**
- Temporal standardization
- Missing value imputation
- Data validation protocols

🔄 **Current Phase: Feature Engineering**


📅 **Planned Analysis**


## Data Source
